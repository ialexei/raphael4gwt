#summary raphael4gwt getting started guide.


=What is it?=

A gwt lightweight java API for raphaeljs (http://raphaeljs.com/). It uses gwt overly types for implementing zero overhear java API for raphaeljs.
Based on raphaeljs 2.0. All raphaeljs features supported. Very straightforward java  API to raphael javascript API.


=How to use it?=

1) add the following in your project's gwt.xml file:

{{{
<inherits name="org.sgx.raphael4gwt.Raphael4Gwt" />
}}}

2) add the .jar to your gwt project's classpath
3) you are ready to use it, from your entry point class:
Paper paper = Raphael.paper(0, 0, 500, 500);
Circle circle1 = paper.circle(250,250, 100);
circle1.setAttribute("fill", "red");
circle1.mouseDown(new MouseEventListener() {			
	@Override
	public void notifyMouseEvent(NativeEvent e) {
		Window.alert("mouse clicked the circle at: "+e.getClientX()+", "+e.getClientY());
	}
});


the objective is to provide the most direct java API to raphaeljs javascript API.
Nevertheless, when javascript overloading methods is overused in javascript, 
some API methods are renamed from original. For example, Element.attr function
is Divided into Shap.setAttribute(s) and getAttribute(s). 
Also artificial classes like MouseEventListener and Attrs, but always performing critical 
operations with zero overhead.



why another raphael gwt porting?

I'm learning best practice for porting existing javascript toolkits to gwt.
I didn't like some desitions of existing raphael porting to gwt http://code.google.com/p/raphaelgwt/
for example, each figure seems to be a gwt widget. There is no way of registering event handlers directly 
using raphaeljs API.  

The project raphaelgwt, is a known raphael api for gwt. It is well integrated with GWT widgets for example
each raphael shap like circles, rectangles, etc are gwt widgets. raphaelgwt uses gwt event system for manage 
raphael shapes events.  

This can be good because it allows that wraps the overlay with a more Java-friendly API that will operate side-by-side 
with other GWT Widgets. raphaelgwt also has the class RaphaelJS. 

raphael4gwt on the other side is focusing on a good native java api for raphaeljs.Basically the main objective is to provide a 100%
java API implementation of raphael js api. Basically this means that, int your gwt applications you have to use raphael4gwt the as you 
would use raphaeljs natively. You create a raphael paper in some existing dom element, draw circles, text paths in that paper and 
posible register some events handlers. There exists a simple PaperWidget, a gwt widget with a raphael paper inside. But raphaels circles, 
rects, paths, etc won't be gwt Widgets as oposition to raphaelgwt. 

in raphael4gwt, raphael shapes shapes events are not related at all with gwt widgets events. raphael4gwt uses gwt.client.dom classes for
referencing html dom objects.

Currently raphaelgwt is based on raphaeljs 1.x, while raphael4gwt is based on raphael 2.x.
