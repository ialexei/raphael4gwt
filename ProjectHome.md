A direct and compatible way of making vector graphics in GWT Java, using the nice raphaeljs (http://raphaeljs.com/), a javascript vector graphics library.

See online Demo with a lot of tests and java source code available:
[raphael4gwt example gallery demo](http://cancerbero.vacau.com/gwt/raphael4gwtGallery/).

raphael4gwt is a GWT lightweight java API for doing vector drawing supporting all browsers (SVG or VML in the case of Internet Explorer). It uses GWT overlay types for implementing zero overhear java API of raphaël javascript library.

Very straightforward object oriented java API to raphaël javascript API so users who know how to use raphaël will easily get started with raphael4gwt.

Based on raphaeljs 2.0 and always updated to latest raphaël version. All raphaël features supported, including eve. Cool 3rd party raphaël based tools like freetransform, graphael, and more are included. Also raphael4gwt contains Java friendly API to complex concepts like gradients, animations, etc.

The examples in the demo are being written along with the API implementation, and demonstrate how to do specific things. I hope they can help you to easily learn how to use the API.

It also support the full [graphael chart library](http://g.raphaeljs.com/) for making charts in java as a separate GWT module, plus some cool chart types contributed by graphael users like radar, sunburst, raphalytics, coxcomb and more. See the [chars example gallery](http://cancerbero.vacau.com/gwt/graphael4gwtGallery/), and the [started guide  http://code.google.com/p/raphael4gwt/wiki/GRaphael4GwtGettingStarted](getting.md) for starting to write charts in GWT.

Like the previous, also the nice charts library [raphycharts](http://softwarebyjosh.com/raphy-charts/), based on raphaeljs, is supported in a separate module. Look at the [example gallery](http://cancerbero.freevar.com/raphael4gwtraphy/) for look at chart examples with available Java source code online.
